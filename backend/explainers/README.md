# SHAP Explainers

Drop the serialized SHAP explainer binaries generated by `train_models.py` in this directory. The backend looks for:

- `engine_shap_explainer.pkl`
- `naval_shap_explainer.pkl`

Files in this folder are git-ignored so we keep the repository lightweight. Rebuild the explainers any time you retrain the paired models and restart the FastAPI service so it reloads them.
