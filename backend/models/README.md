# Model Artifacts

Place the serialized `.pkl` files generated by `train_models.py` in this folder so the FastAPI service can load them at startup. The application expects:

- `marine_model.pkl`
- `engine_shap_explainer.pkl` (stored under `backend/explainers/`)
- `naval_model.pkl`
- `naval_shap_explainer.pkl` (stored under `backend/explainers/`)

Add any regenerated versions with the same filenames, or update the paths in `main.py` if you choose different names. This folder is intentionally kept empty in version control so you can ship lightweight sources while keeping large binary assets local.
